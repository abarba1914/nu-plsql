--- Adding Amy's AF dashboard

--- Total Lybunts - Located in Giving Summary. Should be good to go.
--- Lybunts retained - Is this calculated in Tableau or SQL?
--- KLC Lybunt attainted - See above ^
--- New KLC Household - I already have Amy's KLC view in the code. Should be good to go.
--- KLC 10K+ - I added this from Amy's KLC view. Should be good to go. 
--- Count of visits: I create code instead of joining on a view (for efficenect). Should be good to go.
