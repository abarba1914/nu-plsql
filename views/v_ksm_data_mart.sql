Assorted views for the KSM data mart

Conventions:
- id_number renamed to catracks_id
- Code fields end in _code
- Translated values of the code fields end in _desc for description
- Include both string and converted date versions of e.g. start/stop date
  E.g. interest_start_dt
- Fields ending in _dt are strings and those ending in _date are dates
- Always include date added and modified in the disaggregated data views
