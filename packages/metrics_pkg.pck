/*********************** About pipelined functions ***********************
Q: What is a pipelined function?

A: Pipelined functions are used to return the results of a cursor row by row.
This is an efficient way to re-use a cursor between multiple programs. Pipelined
tables can be queried in SQL exactly like a table when embedded in the table()
function. My experience has been that thanks to the magic of the Oracle compiler,
joining on a table() function scales hugely better than running a function once
on each element of a returned column. Note that the exact columns returned need
to be specified as a public type, which I did in the type and table declarations
above, or the pipelined function can't be run in pure SQL. Alternately, the
pipelined function could return a generic table, but the columns would still need
to be individually named.

Examples: 
Select ksm_af.*
From table(rpt_pbh634.ksm_pkg_tmp.tbl_alloc_annual_fund_ksm) ksm_af;
Select cal.*
From table(rpt_pbh634.ksm_pkg_tmp.tbl_current_calendar) cal;
