/* FY21 Kellogg Investor's Report
    Previously based on Campaign giving through the entire counting period, FY07 through FY19
    -- UPDATE for FY21: counts only the current year's giving
    See Paul's "Investor's Report" folder on the G drive for criteria and notes
    See GitHub for the complete version history: https://github.com/phively/nu-plsql/tree/master/sql%20code/IR%20FY19
    Shouldn't take more than 8 minutes to run to completion
    
    Updates for FY19:
    - Added 1 to all the years, table names, column names, etc. next to an <UPDATE THIS> tag
    - v_ksm_giving_campaign needed to be updated with campaign_steward_thru, anon_steward_thru, nonanon_steward_thru 
        for 2019 (https://github.com/phively/nu-plsql/blob/master/views/ksm_giving_trans_views.sql)
    - Updated comments, where applicable
    - BIG CHANGE: tbl_ir_fy19_approved_names will store all the final IR names from FY18, which will be used as the
        starting point for this year's names. The previous format appears as a "constructed_name" column. If there's
        a difference from the constructed name I'll still toggle one of the "manually check" flags.
    
    N.B. no new report in FY20
    
    Updates for FY21:
    - Checked all the <UPDATE THIS> indicators and revised where needed
    - DO NEXT: revise giving level definitions: now based on stewardship_credit_amount from ksm_pkg (used in v_ksm_giving_summary
        among others)
    - TO DO: pull Cornerstone from the gift club (this group might not be called out, but it's future-proofing)
    - TO DO: create approved names table for FY19 IR
    - TO DO: check manual householding from FY19
