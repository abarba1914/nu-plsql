Create Or Replace Function advance.master_addr(id In varchar2, field In varchar2)
/*
Created by pbh634
Takes an ID and field and returns active master address, defined as preferred if available, else home, else business.
Standardizes input fields to lower-case.

Sample output (prompt -> result):
advance.master_addr('0000704936', 'city')       -> Chicago
advance.master_addr('0000704936', 'sTaTe_CoDe') -> IL
